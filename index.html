    <h1>Week 2 Testing your Understanding</h1>
    <p>I find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" title="Machine Learning Wiki" target="_blank" <strong>Machine Learning</strong></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial Intelligence Wiki" target="_blank" <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></a> to be a very interesting topic. Ever since I saw the movie iRobot with Will Smith I was intrigued on how powerful <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> can be and how scary at the same time. From all the different science fiction movies they always depict <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> in a manner where they always get too powerful and try to eliminate all humans and take over the planet. Although this is definitely something scary and I think is very much possible in the future I still believe <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> is the future of technology.
